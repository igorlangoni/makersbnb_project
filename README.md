# Team Puffins' MakersBnB - Full-Stack Project
## Overview

This amazing group project was the final project for the Sotware Engineer Foundation Course with the Makers Bootcamp. Our task was to create a website based on Airbnb with as many features from their website as we could implement. This was also an opportunity to get experience working under Agile methodologies.

We were given user stories and project specifications to be used as guidelines along with 'nice-to-have' features if we wanted to challenge ourselves further. <br><br>
Specifications were: 
<ul>
  <li>Any signed-up user can list a new space.</li>
  <li>Users can list multiple spaces.
  <li>Users should be able to name their space, provide a short description of the space, and a price per night.
  <li>Users should be able to offer a range of dates where their space is available.
  <li>Any signed-up user can request to hire any space for one night, and this should be approved by the user that owns that space.
  <li>Nights for which a space has already been booked should not be available for users to book that space.
  <li>Until a user has confirmed a booking request, that space can still be booked for that night.
</ul>

'Nice-to-Have':
<ul>
  <li>Users should receive an email whenever one of the following happens: 
  <br>- They sign up
  <br>- They create a space
  <br>- They update a space
  <br>- A user requests to book their space
  <br>- They confirm a request
  <br>- They request to book a space
  <br>- Their request to book a space is confirmed
  <br>- Their request to book a space is denied
  <li>Users should receive a text message to a provided number whenever one of the following happens:
  <br>- A user requests to book their space
  <br>- Their request to book a space is confirmed
  <br>- Their request to book a space is denied 
</ul>

<br>

## ToolStack
The tools/frameworks we used were: Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Git

<br>

## Agile

We followed Agile methodologies to the best of our capabilities. We broke the project up into smaller portions, had daily stand-up and stand-down meetings, assigned tickets and had short, fixed-term sprints.
